# Carbo-Calculator for Running Workout

Project to calculate the necessary carbohydrates to consume and how often to consume them. 
The project is still under development.

## 📖Description

The Carb Calculator is a tool designed for runners who want to accurately plan their carbohydrate intake during a running session.
The program calculates how many energy foods to take based on:
- total distance
- pace per kilometer
- estimated running duration
- hourly supplementation strategy (e.g., 30 g/h, 60 g/h, 90 g/h, etc.)
- carbohydrate content of the energy foods used

The tool provides a clear estimate of your total carbohydrate requirement and the number of gels needed to sustain your performance. It also lets you evaluate how often you should take them.

## 🎯 Main Features

- Automatically calculates session duration based on distance and pace
- Estimates total carbohydrate needs based on the chosen strategy (g/h)
- Calculates the number of gels needed, based on g of carbohydrates per gel
- Recommends your intake throughout the run
- Ability to customize different foods
